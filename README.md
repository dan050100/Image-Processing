# Image-Processing-Tasks

Implemented in MATLAB.

A novel approach to binarize both handwritten and printed documents which fuses multiple techniques into one method. Canny edge detection, sobel edge detection, otsu thresholding, laplacian sharpening, as well as calculating an estimate for stroke width have all been combined to produce results of a higher accuray than each of the individual techniques that were previously stated. Both objective and subjective testing was carried out on the images in order to retrieve these results.

The research paper as well as the program produced and the images used for results are available to be downloaded.
